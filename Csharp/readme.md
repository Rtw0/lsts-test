C# application to be runnable requires .NET Framework 4.5.2+ .                                                   
Simply running the .exe with words.txt and arithmetic.txt in the same folder does the job.                                         
No external libraries were used.                                                                                            
Executable is located in ../Test_pt/bin/Debug/                                                                              
My result files are in /results folder
